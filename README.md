# vibro_hearing_fMRI

In this fMRI experiment, we aim to transform the speech into vibrotactile stimulus and see if itself and the speech aided by this stimulus can provide people with a strengthened ability to recognize speech, especially for people with hearing function loss. This repository stores codes for generating the vibrotactile stimulus, and codes for generating speech.
